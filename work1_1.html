        <p class="SectionTitle"> Problem & Objective</p>
        <p class="problem">
          <span class="italic">'Canada's iconic department store: Hudson’s Bay'</span></br>
          Hudson’s Bay has been accompanying Canadian’s lifestyle with a wide range of products.
          Although their business is extensive, their online presence has not been portraying
          the company's capacity sufficiently. As today’s consumer activity is heavily on e-commerce,
          Hudson’s Bay is making an effort in creating a better digital appearance as Gerald Storch,
          CEO of HBC says,
        </p>
        <p class="obj_quote">
          "We are operating under the assumption that the business will remain
          difficult and that we’re going to have to have a more efficient,
          nimbler model than our competitors, lower our cost of doing business,
          particularly in bricks-and-mortar and we’re going to grow rapidly
          online to compensate for that. We want to have the shift that’s able
          to do that in these turbulent condition. We are focused on no excuses,
          leading the pack, doing the things we have to do to get ahead of this,
          so that we don’t have to sit here and apologize quarter after quarter for
          not doing our numbers."
        </p>
        <p class="objective">
          The objective of this study is to re-design Hudson’s Bay Website that </br><span class="bold">holds together
          the company’s shattered identity</span> and <span class="bold">effectively displays user needs</span>.

          Identify the current website’s problem through user testing
          and synthesize the findings into design opportunities.
        </p>
          <div class="opportunity">
            <p>Opporunity #1 - Hudson’s Bay serves so many divisions.
              The current website runs these divisions in separate sites without any coherence.
              The website should have a common ground for separated channels to give
              consistant user experience.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="opportunity">
            <p>Opportunity #2 - The site is hard to navigate with repeated information and an irregular
              interface pattern. The website should contain concise information architecture
              and have natural interface pattern.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="opportunity1">
            <p>Opporunity #3 - The site contains a lot of products and easy busy telling the user
              what they can offer but is not doing a good job at learning what the user wants.
              The website should communicate both ways and think in user’s perspective.

            <p class="p_desc">
              Hudson’s Bay should take advantage of the favoured reputation of being
              “Canadian” and melt-in their Canadian identity into their presense to distinguish from others.

            <p class="p_desc">
              Hudson’s Bay covers so many different products, brands and services,
              it’s easy to miss what they offer. The website should eliminate repeated
              information and display the services through one channel.

            <p class="p_desc">
            Hudson’s Bay runs a separate blog that creates jewel stone contents.
            The website should tie in the blog contents to products in sales.
