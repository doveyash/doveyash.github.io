          <span class="italic">'Canada's iconic department store: Hudson’s Bay'</span></br>
          Hudson’s Bay has been accompanying Canadian’s lifestyle with a wide range of products.
          Although their business is extensive, their online presence has not been portraying
          the company's capacity sufficiently. As today’s consumer activity is heavily on e-commerce,
          Hudson’s Bay is making an effort in creating a better digital appearance as Gerald Storch,
          CEO of HBC says,
        </p>
        <p class="work_quote2">
          "We are operating under the assumption that the business will remain
          difficult and that we’re going to have to have a more efficient,
          nimbler model than our competitors, lower our cost of doing business,
          particularly in bricks-and-mortar and we’re going to grow rapidly
          online to compensate for that. We want to have the shift that’s able
          to do that in these turbulent condition. We are focused on no excuses,
          leading the pack, doing the things we have to do to get ahead of this,
          so that we don’t have to sit here and apologize quarter after quarter for
          not doing our numbers."
